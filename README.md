# 👨‍🏭 Mr Maven

Mr Maven provides a system for cybermanagement of Maven that's a convenience and/or synthesis level "above" Maven, or a "meta" echelon. It uses focused regional approaches from a front-line "service desk" that encompasses abstract yet advanced optimizing parallelism. This in turn improves throughout in distributed workloads (optimized for Kubernetes or other contexts) with a single entry-point orchestration cross-platform organizational actuating hub.


## 🔧 Build It

This is easy. Simply run:

    mvn package


## 🏃‍♀️ Run It

You'll first need to build it; see the above section. Once built, you can run it via:

    java -jar target/mr-maven-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Of course, you'll want to incorporate it into local projects after it's deployed or installed into a repository. The above is merely and/or usually done for testing.
